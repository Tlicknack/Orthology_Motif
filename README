This code is imperfect but contains the nessesary scripts to discover DNA elements with assemblies (FASTA), annotations (GFF), expression data (FPKM), and orthology relationships (POFF).
Please email tlicknac@asu.edu for details

Script Order:
  getUpstream_All_Aurelias.R
    use POFF table to extract 200nts upstream of each gene in family, combine into fasta file
  MEME_Automated_Query.py
    submit to cluster to run MEME on a directory of fasta's
  getMEME_All_Info.R
    get everything needed for each gene family from MEME: PSSM, consensus seq, mismatch ratio (custom), AT content, position
  Motif_Preliminary_Analysis.R 
    Simple summary of motifs: whiich are duplicated, which are close to start, which only come in a few variants, etc
    MUST SCREEN MOTIFS TO PICK WHICH ARE TO BE USED FOR DOWNSTREAM ANALYSIS
  getPWM_Scores_Paramecium.R
    applies PSSM to genome(s) and returns high-score positions
      Requires: getPWM_Scores.cpp
  ConnectPWM_Position_Annotation.R
    combines annotation from GFF to PWM positions
  ConnectPWM_Expression_toAnnotation_PTET.R
    combines expression data from FPKM to annotated PWM positions
  PWM_Expression_Analysis
    #Correlation between distnace to start codon and expression. pwm score and expression
  ...
